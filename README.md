# Sprint Challenge: Introduction to iOS Programming - Calculator

This challenge allows you to practice the concepts and techniques learned over the past week and apply them in a concrete project. This Sprint provided an introduction to iOS progamming. During this sprint you studied the Xcode IDE, table views and the foundations of Swift. In your challenge this week, you will demonstrate proficiency by creating an application that performs basic arithmetic calculations.

## Instructions

**Read these instructions carefully. Understand exactly what is expected _before_ starting this Sprint Challenge.**

This is an individual assessment. All work must be your own. Your challenge score is a measure of your ability to work independently using the material covered through this sprint. You need to demonstrate proficiency in the concepts and objectives introduced and practiced in preceding days.

You are not allowed to collaborate during the Sprint Challenge. However, you are encouraged to follow the twenty-minute rule and seek support from your PM and Instructor in your cohort help channel on Slack. Your work reflects your proficiency in iOS and your command of the concepts and techniques in this first unit.

You have three hours to complete this challenge. Plan your time accordingly.

## Commits

Commit your code regularly and meaningfully. This helps both you (in case you ever need to return to old code for any number of reasons) and your project manager.

## Description

In this challenge, you will build an app that performs the functions of a basic calculator.

In meeting the minimum viable product (MVP) specifications listed below, your application will be able to perform basic arithmetic and present the answer on the screen in the output label.

## Project Set Up

This repository contains a starter project that includes the UI for the calculator screen already set up. Use this project as the basis for your work.

## Minimum Viable Product

Your finished project must include all of the following requirements:

* 

In your solution, it is essential that you follow best practices and produce clean and professional results. Schedule time to review, refine, and assess your work and perform basic professional polishing including spell-checking and grammar-checking on your work. It is better to submit a challenge that meets the minimum requirements than one that attempts too much and does not.

Validate your work through testing the app on the simulator and ensure that your code operates as designed.

## Stretch Problems

After finishing your required elements, you can push your work further. These goals may or may not be things you have learned in this module but they build on the material you just studied. Time allowing, stretch your limits and see if you can deliver on the following optional goals:

*
